I am Yi-Ling Qiao (pronunced as "Yee-ling Chee-ow"), a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [UMD GAMMA Group](https://gamma.umd.edu/) advised by [Prof. Ming C. Lin](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~lin/) at University of Maryland, College Park. During my undergraduate years, I was advised by [Prof. Lin Gao](http://geometrylearning.com/lin/) and [Prof. Xilin Chen](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0004799?language=en).



My research is about physically-based simulation, graphics and machine learning and is supported by [Meta PhD Fellowship](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2023/4/announcing-the-2023-meta-research-phd-fellowship-award-winners/) (AR/VR Computer Graphics Track). Here is my [Research Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YyvnaUZosZhO9-4AkBYVas1sFKoMompT/view?usp=sharing).


Software:
+ Differentiable simulation: 
  - [differentiable rigid body and cloth simulation](https://github.com/YilingQiao/diffsim) 
  - [differentiable articulated body simulation](https://github.com/YilingQiao/diffarticulated) 
  - [differentiable soft body simulation](https://github.com/YilingQiao/diff_fem) 
  - [differentiable traffic simulation](https://github.com/SonSang/diff-hybrid-traffic-sim)
  - [differentiable analog quantum computing](https://github.com/YilingQiao/diffquantum)
  - [graident-informed PPO](https://github.com/SonSang/gippo)
+ Simulation + NeRF: 
  - [NeRF and FEM](https://github.com/gaoalexander/neuphysics)
  - [NeRF and MPM](https://github.com/xuan-li/PAC-NeRF)
  - [Dynamic mesh-aware NeRF](https://github.com/YilingQiao/DMRF)
